# LinearDataStructures

### Overview

This Java application serves as a demonstration of custom implementations of common linear data structures. Each data structure is designed to provide a basic understanding of their inherent methods and functionalities.

### Implemented Data Structures

1. Array - Custom implementation of an array with essential methods for manipulation and retrieval.
2. Linked List - Implementation of a singly linked list with methods for insertion and deletion.
3. Stack - Custom stack implementation with push and pop operations.
4. Queue - Implementation of a basic queue with enqueue and dequeue operations.
